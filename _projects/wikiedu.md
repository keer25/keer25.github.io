The Wiki Ed Dashboard / Programs & Events Dashboard is a Ruby on Rails + Javascript application that helps people organize groups of newcomers to contribute to Wikipedia. This project aims to use ORES (Objective Revision Evaluation Service) to provide specific useful editing suggestions to newcomers about how they can improve existing Wikipedia articles or article drafts they are working on. This can give an idea of what kind of improvements are needed for the article and gives them a jumpstart in their contributions.<br>
